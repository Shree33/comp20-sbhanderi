Assignment 4: Security
Author: Shreeenath Bhanderi

In this assignment, I was assigned a partner and assessed his server and website for security and privacy issues. I used multiple tools as well as my understanding of common vulnerabilities to find three issues in his implementation and how to resolve them.


All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented.

I did not collaborate with anyone but I did use ideas for possible breaches from Piazza.


I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment.
