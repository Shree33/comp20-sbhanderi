Assignment 2: Landmarks
Author: Shreenath Bhanderi

This assignment involved several different parts. It required sending location data to a server and retrieve data of other users and landmarks nearby back. I then used the google maps api to display the data with custom markers and created infowindows upon clicking on a marker. Finally, the haversine formula was used to find the closest landmark to my location and I rendered a simple polyline from my location to the landmark.




Everything has been correctly implemented. I decided to put the javascript in a separate file even though that was not required to clean up the program. 
I spoke to Alyssa Fusillo to discuss the requirements for the assignment. 

I based my distance function off the the implementation found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
