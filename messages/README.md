Messages Lab
Author: Shreenath Bhanderi

This website pulls data from the included json file and displays it on the html page correctly formatted.

Implementation: Everything has been correctly implemented according to the  instructions.

Collaboration: I did not discuss this lab with anyone else.

Hours: This lab took 2 hours to finish.

Questions: is it possible to request the data from a different origin (e.g., http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/) or from your local machine (from file:///) from using XMLHttpRequest? Why or why not?: No, Since XMLHttpRequest adheres to same-origin policy, we can not access the data located in those locations.
