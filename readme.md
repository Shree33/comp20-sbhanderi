What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
This git repository is a display of my work this semester for Comp 20. It shows the amount of effort and the wide variety of tools which I have used to accomplish the labs and assignments in this class.



What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
I really enjoyed assignment three because I was challenged to use multiple new technologies and make several moving parts work together for a cohesive product. It made me feel like I was working on something much more substantial to have to worry about linking so many different technologies together.


How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have opened my eyes to the amount of complexity that is behind the click of a button on a web page. At the same time, I now realize that I have the skills to accompish what I want if I take the time to finagle and google my way through each obstacle.


What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

I believe the most important thing I learned was about reading documentation. In other computer science classes I have taken, most, if not all, the information you need to make your assignment work is given to you. In this class, I may or may not be told which technology to use but I would have to go to that technology's documentation to understand how to make it do the things that I want to accomplish. For one instance, we were told that Burp Suite might be useful for finding vulnerabilities in another student's site for assignment 4 but I had to real delve deep into the information written about it to get the software to work. For my group assignment, I really had to learn about the potential and the limitations of the google maps api to render the map that I wanted with the information that I needed.


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I believe I want to delve deeper into concurrent use with comp 50: Concurrency and deeper into the infrastructure of the internet and networking with comp 116: Networking.
